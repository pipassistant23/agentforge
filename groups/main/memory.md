# Long-term Memory

Important facts, decisions, and patterns that persist across sessions.

## How This Works

- **Daily logs** are in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday loaded each session)
- **Long-term facts** are stored here when patterns are confirmed
- Update this file when you notice recurring preferences or important context

## User Preferences

(Facts about user preferences discovered across multiple sessions)

## Project Context

(Important information about ongoing projects)

## Decisions & Patterns

(Notable decisions and patterns that inform future behavior)

## Important Notes
