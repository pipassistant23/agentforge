# Daily memory logs

This directory contains daily log files in the format YYYY-MM-DD.md.

These logs are created automatically and capture:
- Conversations and interactions
- Decisions made during the day
- Important context discovered
- Tasks completed or scheduled

The agent reads today's log + yesterday's log at the start of each session.
